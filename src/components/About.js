        <p>
          My name is Tyler Neal and I aspire to be a web developer. I have lived in Ohio my whole life, therefore I am a huge Buckeye fan! I am the oldest of four children and I just recently became a dad. My daughter was born in June. Her name is Lucy.
          In my spare time I like to cook, play video games and talk cars.
